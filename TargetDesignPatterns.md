# ⭐ The Minimum Useful Set (Real-World Relevant)

If you learn these **12 patterns**, you will be ahead of **90% of developers**.

## 🟦 Behavioral Patterns (Very Important)

These patterns focus on communication between objects and how they interact.

1. **Strategy** - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable
2. **Observer** - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
3. **Command** - Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests
4. **Template Method** - Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses
5. **Iterator** - Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
6. **State** - Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes

## 🟥 Creational Patterns (Used Everywhere)

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. **Singleton** - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it
2. **Factory Method** - Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate
3. **Builder** - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
4. **Prototype** _(Already learned)_ - Create new objects by copying an existing object

## 🟩 Structural Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between entities.

1. **Adapter** - Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
2. **Decorator** - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
3. **Facade** - Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
